Howdy, I'm Courtney Shearer, Welcome to my website!
</p>
<p>
I am a third year PhD candidate working with <a href='https://www.deboramarkslab.com/deboramarks'>Debora Marks</a> at Harvard Medical School in the <a href="https://gsas.harvard.edu/programs-of-study/all/systems-biology">SSQB program. </a> I am supported by a NSF-GFRP fellowship.

</p>
<p>
I love all things <a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Bioinformatics#:~:text=Bioinformatics%20is%20a%20subdiscipline%20of,DNA%20and%20amino%20acid%20sequences.">bioinformatics</a>, <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/catalyst/v19i6/systems-biology-as-defined-by-nih#:~:text=Systems%20biology%20is%20an%20approach,involves%20taking%20the%20pieces%20apart.">systems biology</a>, machine learning, and my arm can be twisted to write some <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/30-best-practices-software-development-and-testing">"good software"</a>.
</p>
<p>
Generally, Im interested in learning from both evolutionary (deep and presently!) and experimental biological sequence data. Currently, im thinking about problems in variant effect prediction across the whole genome and the design of genomic level sequences for therapeutics, agriculture, and beyond.</p>

<p>
In my "free time" I exercise liberally, craft wildly, and spend time with my partner, lovingly.
</p>
